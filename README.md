## Overview
The purpose of this project was to provide a place where users can filter through a table of data. The user will be able to filter by date, city, state, country and shape.

## Results
To filter through the data, you will need to scroll to the bottom of the page. Once you are at the bottom of the page you can enter in the criteria necessary. For example, to filter for all instances on 1/10/2010 in the us, you would enter 1/10/2010 in the date field and us in the country field.

## Summary
One drawback to this design is that there are multiple filters, with an example of what to input. I think that could be confusing and it is better to leave the filter box blank. You could add a filter for duration, as well. Also, you could change the layout of the page so that the filters are above the table. This will provide a cleaner webpage to browse.
